About me 
======
Howard earned his B.A. from [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/), majoring in Mathematics and Economics, and now embarks on his next chapter at the University of Pennsylvania's Master's program in [AMCS (Applied Math and Computational Science)](https://amcs.upenn.edu/).

Howard aspires to apply rigorous quantitative methods to address operational inefficiencies, financial innovation, and sustainability challenges. His short-term goal is to obtain a PhD in Mathematics or Statistics, where he aims to focus on pioneering research and expanding the boundaries of mathematical methodologies. Armed with these enhanced capabilities, he plans to transition into the industry in the long term, using advanced quantitative techniques to create data-driven strategies that empower communities, boost sustainability, and drive meaningful progress.

MAS for Finance, a Multi-agent LLM Financial Trading Model on Crypto Perpetual

Collaborating with postdoc Xiaoxing Wang and Ning Liao on designing multi-agent LLM orchestration with continual learning and probabilistic calibration for adaptive, explainable decision-making in financial trading systems. Our model incorporates five types of agents to replicate the workflow pipeline of a hedge fund: Analysts, Researchers, Traders, Risk Managers, and Evaluators. The system ingests two distinct streams of information, text-based news data and time-series price data, and enables agents to perform trading activities while continually improving through feedback. Each agent type has its own responsibilities and draws from specialized methodological inventories⁽³⁾ to complete tasks. Their performance is assessed against fixed metrics defined by the Evaluator Agent after each trading round⁽⁴⁾. Following every K iterations, the top performer within each agent category transfers knowledge to its peers, and the process repeats.
